            <div class="col-md-10"> <p>He was born into Tamilian Brahmin family. His father was the clerk in the saree shop. He is from Thanjavur district. His mother sang at local temple. They resided in Sarangipani Street, Kumbakonam. His house now is a Museum.</p></div>

            <div class="col-md-10"> <p>He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

    <p>In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of a A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems.Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail. The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening his genius. The next year,<b> Ramanujan independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places</b>. His peers at the time commented that they "rarely understood him" and "stood in respectful awe" of him.</p><p>
          <ul><li>    On 6 December 1917, he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. </li>
<li>
In 1918, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society , and<b> he was the youngest Fellow in the entire history of the Royal Society.</b></li>
<li>
On 13 October 1918, he became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</li></ul>

          <div class="col-md-10"><p>While still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations.</p>
            <p>The first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second notebook has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, with the third notebook containing 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself created papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did G. N. Watson, B. M. Wilson, and Bruce Berndt. A fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called <b>"lost notebook"</b>, was rediscovered in 1976 by George Andrews</p> <b><u>The black hole connection</u>

            <p>A new formula, inspired by the<b> mysterious work of Srinivasa Ramanujan, could improve our understanding of black holes</b>.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-10"><p>In mathematics, Ramanujan's congruences are some remarkable congruences for the partition function p(n). The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan discovered the congruences:<br>
  
    p(5k+4)=0 (mod 5)<br>
  p(7k+5)=0 (mod 7)<br>
p(11k+6)=0 (mod 11)<br>

          <div class="col-md-10"><p>The number 1729 is known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital. In Hardy's words:</p>
<p>
I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No", he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."</p>
<p>
Immediately before this anecdote, Hardy quoted Littlewood as saying, <b>"Every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends."</b></p>

            <p>The two different ways are</p>

            <p>1729 = (1*1*1) + (12*12*12) = (9*9*9) + (10*10*10).</p>
            <p>Generalizations of this idea have created the notion of "taxicab numbers".</p></div>
