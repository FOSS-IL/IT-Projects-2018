### SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN

This is a web page on Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the greatest mathematician in the history of India and the entire world.  
Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable.

Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation.
He had produced groundbreaking new theorems, with sir Hardy During his short life.
Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations).

This is an effort to spread some light on his life and work, to make people aware of his love and contribution towards mathematics.
